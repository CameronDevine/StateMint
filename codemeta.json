  "description": "This library is used to take the elemental equations and constraint equations of a system and find a differential equation in a standard form. This script is a port from a Mathematica notebook with the same functionality but was ported to allow it to be run using an AWS Lambda function, allowing anyone to run the code without having Python/sympy or Mathematica installed.",
