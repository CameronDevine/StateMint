StateModelRnD is a set of tools to symbolically determine the differential equation describing the dynamics of a system.
As inputs these tools take the elemental and constraint equations of a system.
A [tutorial](tutorial.md) is available which covers how to prepare equations for use with these tools.

### Mathematica

The Mathematica [package](mathematica) was the original implementation of this tool.
An [example](mathematica/Example.nb) of how to use the Mathematica package is provided.

### Python

A Python [package](python) was also created to provide an open source implementation of this tool using [SymPy](www.sympy.org).
This package allows anyone to use this tool on their own computer without having to obtain a license for proprietary software.
An [example](python/Example.ipynb) of how to use the Python package is also provided.

### Web Interface

A [web interface](web) is also available which uses the Python package as a backend.
This package allows anyone to use this tool without the need to install any software.
An example of this interface is running at [statemodelrnd.camerondevine.me](statemodelrnd.camerondevine.me).
